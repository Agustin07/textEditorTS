Let's test some commands for the textEditorTS

First try using option '-n' with 'p' flag:
node dist/index.js -n "s/g/6/p" test.txt

Try -e:
node dist/index.js -e "s/James/J./" test.txt



Also if you don't use the suggested format for Substitution command: "s/expreg/substitution string/flag" you will be alerted! 
Doing something like this you can check: 
node dist/index.js -e "s/g/6" test.txt   or   node dist/index.js -e "s/6" test.txt

or trying to input an unexisting file: 
node dist/index.js -e "s/g/6/p" tess.txt

even trying with a flag that isn't valid! 
node dist/index.js -e "s/g/6/y" test.txt



Try using -e multiple times, and how about 'g' flag?
node dist/index.js -e "s/James/J./" -e "s/i/1/g" -e "s/-/~/" test.txt

Try using -f that must have a script aside! 
node dist/index.js -f script.sed test.txt

Try to edit some of the substitution command of script.sed or add a new subs command to the list, save and try again: 
node dist/index.js -f script.sed test.txt


You can write a file with something like this:
node dist/index.js -e "s/James/Juan/w fileWrited" test.txt

(then you can find The Juaness' on 'fileWrited.txt' LOL)

Finally you can test getting the output in place with -i, also we can use The Juanes .txt (fileWrited.txt)  try this:
node dist/index.js -i "s/Juan/I'm the real juan/" fileWrited.txt

now open and check "fileWrited.txt" !
